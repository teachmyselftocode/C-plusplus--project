Programming Course Project
The program is designed like a system, which can speed up our learning efficiency during the study time.
I would like to use a certification system to confirm whether the user is Thei student or not. Firstly want to use the student number to confirm, however we donâ€™t know what is the operational password of the number, so we use Hong Kong ID number to verify the user.

This system has totally three functions for users:
1. Mechanics Calculation
2. Read & write txt file
3. Mini game

The first two function is for user to have a better studying method, for example easier to calculate mechanics problem, learning and save the vocabulary check things written in the txt file(Timetable/homework deadline).  I think the mini game can let student to relax after studying, this game is not time consuming and easy to have fun alone and also with others. 

The program is written by few functions in C++, which can make the program make more clear and easy to understand, and also the main program part is short, which can be easier to do the looping for the whole program
